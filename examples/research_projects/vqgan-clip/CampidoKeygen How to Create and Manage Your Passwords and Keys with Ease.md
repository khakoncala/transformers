How to Use NordPass
 
To use NordPass, you need to download and install the app on your device. You can get it from the official website or from the app store. You also need to create an account and set up a master password. The master password is the only password you need to remember to access your NordPass vault. The vault is where all your passwords are stored and encrypted.
 
Once you have set up your account and master password, you can start adding your passwords to your vault. You can do this manually by entering your login details for each website or app, or you can use the import feature to import your passwords from another password manager or browser. You can also use the password generator feature to create new and secure passwords for your accounts.
 
When you visit a website or app that requires a password, you can use NordPass to autofill your login details. You just need to click on the NordPass icon in the password field and select the account you want to use. You can also use NordPass to autofill other information, such as credit card details or personal details.
  
How to Use ssh-keygen
 
To use ssh-keygen, you need to have OpenSSH installed on your computer. OpenSSH is a software suite that provides secure network communication tools, such as SSH, SCP, and SFTP. You can check if you have OpenSSH installed by typing ssh -V in a terminal window. If you see a version number, then you have OpenSSH installed.
 
To generate a key pair for SSH authentication, you need to run ssh-keygen in a terminal window. By default, it will create a 2048-bit RSA key pair and save it in your .ssh directory under your home directory. However, you can customize the key generation process by using different options and arguments. For example, you can specify the algorithm, the key size, the file name, and the passphrase for your key pair.
 
After generating your key pair, you need to copy your public key to the remote server or device that you want to log in to. You can do this by using the ssh-copy-id command or by manually copying and pasting the public key file. Once you have copied your public key, you can log in to the remote server or device without using a password. You just need to enter your passphrase if you have set one for your key pair.
